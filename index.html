            Welcome to Weddings with Anna! I am so glad you are here and I would love to be a part of your wedding. I played my first
            wedding at just 18 years old without knowing what the ‚Äúwedding business‚Äù was all about. As the years went on and
            through planning my own wedding I quickly learned that it‚Äôs an overwhelming space for couples to navigate and even
            more difficult to making your wedding feel unique to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through all of my experience over the years I feel I have found what most couples are looking for‚Ä¶ a real relationship with
            their vendors, especially the band. I want to know your favorite song and why. I want to know about your Uncle
            Bob‚Äôs love of everything Jimmy Buffett. And I want to know you fell in front of your entire school doing the Cha
            Cha slide and you never want to hear that song again!
          </p>
          <p>
            I will plan alongside you and help every step of the way when it comes to your wedding music. But what really sets me apart
            from other wedding coordinators and bands is that I can help plan the music, emcee the evening, play live, and
            DJ. This will give your guests consistency throughout the evening and make it easy for you to customize your wedding
            to whatever you want it to be. I don‚Äôt want my clients to feel like I am providing a cookie cutter experience.
            I would love to talk more with you about your weddings and how I can help!
