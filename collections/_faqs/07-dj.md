question: What's the breakdown of live versus DJ'd music?
answer: The answer to this is completely up to you! We have played live for entire receptions as well as “DJ” the entire evening as well.  We are very flexible, however, we do feel we have found a sweet spot in terms of mixing live with “DJ” music. We often play for the cocktail hour, dinner hour, and into a portion of the dance reception. We then will DJ to provide you and your guests with all the songs you love that we can’t play live. This also gives you a chance to put in requests.
