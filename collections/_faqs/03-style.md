question: What styles of music do you play?
answer: I highly recommend you come see our group, Anna & The Deeper Well, perform live. We play a wide range of music including pop, folk, blues, jazz and country.  We will cater to your specific requests the night of your wedding. We will also DJ any other desired music. You will receive a “DJ” request form prior to your wedding day.
