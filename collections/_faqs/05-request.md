question: We have a special song for our wedding. Will you learn it?
answer: Weddings With Anna will always try to accommodate song requests, making your wedding feel even more personal to you. It is also important for us to keep a song’s integrity, so if it doesn’t work well for our group’s instrumentation we will play the original recording of the music. Depending on the complexity of the song, it may be an additional fee for us to learn it.
