question: Do you provide emceeing and/or act as the master of ceremonies?
answer: Absolutely! I will make all necessary announcements as well as keep the evening running on time.  I coordinate with other vendors to make sure everyone is on the same page.  I want couples to enjoy their evening and not feel responsible for making sure things run smoothly.
