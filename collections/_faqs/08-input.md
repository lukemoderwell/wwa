question: Will we have input into what songs will be played by your band?
answer: We will provide you with our set list prior to your wedding day. We ask that you mark the songs you would like played as well as the songs you do not want played.  We will also take requests to develop a playlist for the “DJ” portion of the evening.  On the day of your wedding we are very intune to what your guests are enjoying and we will play requests as long as it is something that will keep people on the dance floor.
